# Proposals
My ideas for my final project are...

1. Project idea #3: Local garden plant inventory and identification 
- Take data from Chicago’s open data portal for community garden and nature centers and create a model that helps users identify flora and fauna in the garden
- Take in a picture or description of a plant and return possible matches with photos and information 

# Execution Plan 

- Research and Planning & Data Collection
  Objective: Understand the project requirements and plan the development process.
  Tasks:
    Research Chicago’s open data portal for relevant data on community gardens and nature centers.
    Define the scope of the model (types of plants, data available, etc.).
    Draft a project plan detailing the app's features, user interface, and technical requirements.
    Identify tools and frameworks needed for development (Python libraries for image recognition, machine learning, etc.).

    Download relevant datasets from Chicago’s open data portal.
    Analyze the data to understand its structure and quality.
    Clean and preprocess the data for use in the model.
  
- Week 2: Model Development (Part 1)
  Objective: Begin developing the core model for plant identification.
  Tasks:
    Identify APIs for Development
    Select and set up a machine learning framework for image recognition.
    Start developing the model using a subset of the data.
    Begin basic testing of the model with sample images.
- Week 3: Model Development (Part 2) and Initial App Development
  Objective: Finalize the model and start developing the app interface.
  Tasks:
    Complete the development of the identification model.
    Conduct extensive testing and refine the model as needed.
    Start building the basic app interface where users can upload pictures or descriptions.
- Week 4: App Development and Integration
  Objective: Develop the main functionalities of the app and integrate the model.
  Tasks:
    Develop features for the app (uploading images, displaying results, etc.).
    Integrate the identification model with the app.
    Conduct preliminary testing of the app for functionality and user experience.
- Week 5: Testing, Refinement, and Deployment
  Objective: Finalize the user interface and add language to help users use the site
  Tasks:
    Perform comprehensive testing including user experience, model accuracy, and bug fixes.
    Refine the app based on feedback and test results.
    Prepare the app for deployment.
    Create documentation and user guides.
